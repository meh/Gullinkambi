Gullinkambi - a Ragnarok Online client
======================================
Because the world needs a decent Ragnarok Online client, doesn't it?

Choices
-------
The client will be implemented in C++, because that's the most feasable choice,
sadly.

Scripting will be implemented with Google's V8, because fucking fast Javascript
scripting, who wouldn't want it?

OpenGL will be used for the graphics.

OpenAL for the audio part.
